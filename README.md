# Analysing-Student-Feedback-using-Machine-Learning-(v 1.0)
Machine Learning methods like GNB, DecisionTrees, RandomForest were analysed on student feedback data set
## Description

The project is about the analysing the senitment of the student feedback using the supervised machine learning algorithms using python programming language. Information about user’s sentiment is used for a variety of purposes, such as determining their opinion, attitude towards a business or a product. Whereas with the students’ sentiments it can be used to address issues such as learning experience, teaching, and evaluation etc. Analysing sentiment from the Textual feedback manually is a tedious task and require a lot a of time. This project proposes the methods for analysing sentiment in the student feedback using supervised machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Gaussian Na¨ıve Bayes (GNB), Random Forest. This project analysis the sentiment feedback data set and finds the error metrices like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, f1-Score.
